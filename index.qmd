About Me:

I am a research statistician in the statistical sciences department at Sandia National Laboratories where I develop novel statistical approaches to national security problems. I also hold an adjunct faculty position in the department of statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, point process models, Bayesian hierarchical models, and Statistical methods for remotely-sensed data, atmospheric and climate applications.

I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Spanish at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania after growing up skiing and swimming in Park City, Utah. Afterwards, I earned my Ph.D.Â in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where research focus was in spatial-temporal statistics.

Outside of my research, I still compete competitively in swimming and enjoy engaging with and building the local swimming community in Albuquerque!
