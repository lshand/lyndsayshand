    "text": "Welcome to my personal research blog.\nIt is a continual work in progress.\nEmail: lshand@sandia.gov\nLooking for consulting support? See how to reach out here.\nAbout Me:\nI am a research statistician in the statistical sciences department at Sandia National Laboratories where I develop novel statistical approaches to national security problems. I also hold an adjunct faculty position in the department of statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, point process models, Bayesian hierarchical models, and Statistical methods for remotely-sensed data, atmospheric and climate applications.\nI received my B.S. in Mathematics and Spanish at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania after growing up skiing and swimming in Park City, Utah. Afterwards, I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where research focus was in spatial-temporal statistics.\nOutside of my research, I still compete competitively in swimming and enjoy engaging with and building the local swimming community in Albuquerque!"
